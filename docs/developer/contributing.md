### Pull Requests

We welcome pull requests for bug fixes, enhancements, and new features. To submit a pull request:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your changes (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`).
3. Make your changes, following the coding standards outlined below.
4. Write or update tests as necessary.
5. Ensure all tests pass.
6. Commit your changes with clear, descriptive commit messages.
7. Push your branch to your fork (`git push origin feature/your-feature-name`).
8. Submit a pull request to the main repository.

## Development Process

### Branching Strategy

- `main`: The main branch contains the stable version of the application.
- `develop`: The development branch contains the latest development changes.
- Feature branches: Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix, branching off from `develop`.

### Coding Standards

#### General Guidelines

- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code.
- Follow the existing code style and patterns in the project.
- Keep functions and methods small and focused on a single responsibility.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Add comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious behavior.

#### JavaScript/TypeScript Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for type safety.
- Use ES6+ features where appropriate.
- Avoid using `any` type in TypeScript; use proper interfaces and types instead.
- Use async/await for asynchronous code instead of callbacks or raw promises.
- Use const for variables that don't need to be reassigned, and let otherwise.

#### Vue.js Guidelines

- Follow the [Vue.js Style Guide](https://vuejs.org/style-guide/).
- Use composition API for new components.
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility.
- Use props for passing data down to child components.
- Use events for communicating from child to parent components.

#### CSS Guidelines

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling.
- Follow a consistent naming convention for custom CSS classes.
- Keep CSS modular and scoped to components where possible.

### Testing

- Write tests for new features and bug fixes.
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request.
- Aim for good test coverage, especially for critical functionality.

## Documentation

- Update documentation when making changes to the codebase.
- Document new features, API endpoints, and configuration options.
- Use JSDoc comments for functions and classes.
- Keep the README.md and other documentation up to date.

## Review Process

Pull requests will be reviewed by the project maintainers. The review process includes:

1. Checking that the code follows the coding standards.
2. Verifying that the changes work as expected.
3. Ensuring that tests are included and pass.
4. Reviewing documentation updates.

## Getting Help

If you need help with contributing to the project:

1. Check the existing documentation.
