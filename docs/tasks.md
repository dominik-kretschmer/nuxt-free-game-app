# Improvement Tasks for Real-Time Chat Application

## Security Improvements

[ ] Add proper JWT-based authentication instead of insecure cookie-based authentication
[ ] Add CSRF protection for authentication endpoints
[ ] Implement rate limiting for authentication endpoints to prevent brute force attacks
[ ] Add input validation and sanitization for all user inputs
[ ] Protect against SQL injection by using parameterized queries for table names

## Code Quality and Consistency

[ ] Create interfaces for database entities (User, Game, etc.)
[ ] Implement consistent error handling strategy across the application
[ ] Convert migration.js to TypeScript for consistency with the rest of the project

## Architecture Improvements

[ ] Implement a service layer between API endpoints and database entities
[ ] Create a proper authentication middleware for protected routes
[ ] Implement a more robust state management solution (Pinia or Vuex)
[ ] Separate business logic from API endpoints
[ ] Create a proper data validation layer using a library like Zod or Yup
[ ] Implement proper logging with different log levels (error, warn, info, debug)
[ ] Create a configuration management system for environment-specific settings
[ ] Implement a more robust error handling system with custom error classes
[ ] Create reusable composables for common functionality
[ ] Implement proper dependency injection for better testability

## Database and Data Handling

[ ] Implement database migrations with versioning instead of dropping tables
[ ] Add more user fields to the user table (name, created_at, updated_at, etc.)
[ ] Implement soft delete for entities instead of hard delete
[ ] Add database transactions for operations that modify multiple records
[ ] Implement pagination for database queries that return large result sets
[ ] Add indexes to frequently queried columns for better performance
[ ] Create proper data access objects (DAOs) or repositories for database access
[ ] Implement a caching strategy for frequently accessed data
[ ] Add database connection pooling configuration
[ ] Create database backup and restore procedures

## Testing Infrastructure

[ ] Set up a testing framework (Jest, Vitest, or similar)
[ ] Implement unit tests for utility functions and services
[ ] Create integration tests for API endpoints
[ ] Implement end-to-end tests with Cypress or similar
[ ] Set up continuous integration with automated testing
[ ] Add test coverage reporting
[ ] Implement snapshot testing for UI components
[ ] Create mock services for external dependencies in tests
[ ] Add performance testing for critical paths
[ ] Implement security testing (e.g., penetration testing)

## User Experience and UI

[ ] Implement form validation with meaningful error messages
[ ] Add loading indicators for asynchronous operations
[ ] Create a consistent design system with reusable components
[ ] Implement responsive design for mobile devices
[ ] Add proper error handling and user feedback for failed operations
[ ] Implement internationalization (i18n) for supporting multiple languages
[ ] Create accessibility improvements (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, etc.)
[ ] Add dark mode support
[ ] Implement proper navigation with breadcrumbs
[ ] Create user onboarding flow for new users

## Performance Optimization

[ ] Implement code splitting for better initial load time
[ ] Add lazy loading for routes and components
[ ] Optimize images and assets
[ ] Implement server-side rendering or static site generation where appropriate
[ ] Add caching for API responses
[ ] Implement service workers for offline support
[ ] Optimize database queries with proper indexing
[ ] Add performance monitoring and analytics
[ ] Implement debouncing and throttling for user input
[ ] Optimize bundle size with tree shaking and code splitting

[ ] Create user documentation for the application
[ ] Document database schema and relationships
[ ] Add setup and installation instructions
[ ] Create contribution guidelines
[ ] Document deployment process
[ ] Add changelog for tracking version changes
[ ] Create architecture diagrams
[ ] Document security practices and considerations

## DevOps and Deployment

[ ] Set up proper Docker configuration for production
[ ] Implement environment-specific configuration
[ ] Create CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment
[ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
[ ] Implement logging and error tracking
[ ] Create backup and restore procedures
[ ] Implement blue-green deployment strategy
